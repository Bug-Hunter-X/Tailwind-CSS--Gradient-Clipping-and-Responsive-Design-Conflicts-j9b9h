```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Some content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses the `bg-gradient-to-r` utility class to create a gradient background.  However, if this gradient is applied to an element that also has padding (like `p-4` here), the gradient may not appear correctly or might be clipped. This is due to how some browsers handle gradients and padding interaction.

Another uncommon error occurs with complex responsive design using Tailwind.  For example, nested responsive classes can sometimes conflict and unexpected styles appear.

```javascript
<div class="md:grid md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
  <div class="p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8"></div>
  <div class="p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8"></div>
  <div class="p-4 md:p-6 lg:p-8"></div>
</div>
```
Here, the padding changes at different breakpoints. But if the parent container doesn't adjust correctly, the inner elements might overflow.
